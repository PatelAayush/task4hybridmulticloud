We have to create a web portal for our company with all the security as much as possible. So, we use Wordpress software with dedicated database server. Database should not be accessible from the outside world for security purposes. We only need to public the WordPress to clients.    with an additional feature to be added that is NAT Gateway to provide the internet access to instances running in the private subnet.
